An AI-powered search platform that delivers unbiased, hallucination-free, and personalized search results using state-of-the-art AI agents.

## ✨ Features

- 🎯 **Zero Hallucinations**: Multi-layer verification system ensures factual accuracy
- 🔍 **Multi-Source Search**: Aggregates results from DuckDuckGo and knowledge bases
- 👤 **Personalization**: Learns from user interactions to provide tailored results
- 🧠 **Reasoning Engine**: Uses chain-of-thought reasoning for better understanding
- 📊 **Confidence Scoring**: Transparent confidence levels for all results
- ⚡ **High Performance**: Optimized for speed with async operations
- 🎨 **Beautiful UI**: Modern, responsive interface built with Streamlit
- 🔐 **Privacy Focused**: Runs locally with no data collection

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ash-Blanc/smart-search.git
cd smart-search
```

2. Install dependencies (using [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv)):
```bash
uv sync
```

3. Set up environment variables:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your API keys
```

4. Run the application:
```bash
uv run python run.py
```

5. Open your browser to:
- Web UI: http://localhost:8501
- API: http://localhost:8000

## 🏗️ Architecture

Smart Search uses a multi-agent architecture built with the [Agno](https://github.com/agno-agi/agno) framework:

```txt

├── agents/               # AI agents (search, verification, personalization)
│   ├── search_agent.py    # Main search agent with reasoning
│   ├── verification.py    # Fact-checking and hallucination detection
│   └── personalization.py # User preference learning and result personalization
├── api/                  # FastAPI backend and Streamlit frontend
│   ├── main.py            # FastAPI endpoints
│   └── app.py             # Streamlit UI

├── run.py                # Application runner
└── pyproject.toml        # Dependencies
```

## 🔧 Configuration

Create a `.env` file with your API keys:

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
COHERE_API_KEY=your_cohere_api_key_here
```

Edit `config.py` to customize:
- Model selection (`gpt-4o-mini` by default)
- Search depth and timeout
- Confidence thresholds
- Personalization settings

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

- **AI Framework**: [Agno](https://github.com/agno-agi/agno) - Multi-agent orchestration
- **Optimization**: [DSPy](https://github.com/stanfordnlp/dspy) - Prompt optimization
- **LLM**: OpenAI GPT models
- **Vector DB**: [LanceDB](https://github.com/lancedb/lancedb) with hybrid search
- **Backend**: [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/)
- **Frontend**: [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/)
- **Search**: [DuckDuckGo Search](https://pypi.org/project/duckduckgo-search/)
- **Dependency Management**: [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv)

## 📈 Performance
